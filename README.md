# yt-upload-vibelines

Service Overview

This service automatically downloads video files from a specified Google Drive folder and uploads them to a YouTube channel.

* After a successful upload, the service moves the source file in Drive to a configured destination folder.
* If an upload fails, the error is logged and the application continues running; the source file is deleted to prevent reprocessing.


OAuth2 authentication is used for both Google Drive and YouTube APIs. Ensure that the necessary credentials are set up in the application configuration.
== Configuration
The application requires the following configuration parameters:
* `drive.sourceFolderId`: The ID of the Google Drive folder to monitor for new video files.
* `drive.destinationFolderId`: The ID of the Google Drive folder where files will be moved after processing.
* `youtube.channelId`: The ID of the YouTube channel where videos will be uploaded.
* `oauth2.clientId`: The OAuth2 client ID for authentication.
* `oauth2.clientSecret`: The OAuth2 client secret for authentication.
* `oauth2.redirectUri`: The OAuth2 redirect URI.
  == Usage
1. Set up OAuth2 credentials for Google Drive and YouTube APIs.
2. Configure the application with the required parameters.
3. Run the application to start monitoring the specified Google Drive folder for new video files.
4. The application will automatically upload new video files to the specified YouTube channel and move processed files to the destination folder.
   == Error Handling
* Upload failures are logged with error details.
* The application continues processing other files even if some uploads fail.
* Source files are deleted after processing to avoid reprocessing.

#Getting new refresh token
To obtain a new refresh token, follow these steps:
1. Open a web browser and navigate to the following URL, replacing `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUR_REDIRECT_URI`, and `YOUR_SCOPES` with your actual OAuth2 client ID, redirect URI, and required scopes:
```https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?
    client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    &redirect_uri=http://localhost:8080/callback (YOUR_REDIRECT_URI)
    &response_type=code
    &scope=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload%20https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube (YOUR_SCOPES)
    &access_type=offline
    &prompt=consent

You will be prompted to log in to your Google account and authorize the application to access your YouTube and Google Drive data.
2. After granting permission, you will be redirected to the specified redirect URI with an authorization code that is in browser URL as a query parameter named `code`.
3. Copy the authorization code from the URL.
4. Exchange the authorization code for an access token and refresh token by making a POST request to the following URL:
```https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
With the following parameters in the request body:
- `code`: The authorization code you obtained in step 3.
- `client_id`: Your OAuth2 client ID.
- `client_secret`: Your OAuth2 client secret.
- `redirect_uri`: Your OAuth2 redirect URI.
- `grant_type`: Set this to `authorization_code`.
5. The response will contain an access token and a refresh token. Save the refresh token securely, as it will be used to obtain new access tokens when the current one expires.
6. Update your application configuration with the new refresh token.
Make sure to handle the tokens securely and avoid exposing them in public repositories or logs.
